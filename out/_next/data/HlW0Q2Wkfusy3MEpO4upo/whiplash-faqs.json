Your body is under a lot of stress and strain, and the sooner you get started on treatment, the better. Below are common whiplash questions that we receive at our practice.</p>\n<h2>What Is Whiplash?</h2>\n<p>Whiplash is a neck injury that occurs when your head is forcefully jerked forward and backward. This injury can happen in a car accident, fall, or any other type of trauma. Whiplash can cause pain and stiffness in the neck and shoulders. Although, this injury can also cause headaches and dizziness. Whiplash is common after a car accident and can be painful.</p>\n<h2>What Are the Symptoms of Whiplash?</h2>\n<p>The most common whiplash symptoms are pain and neck and shoulder stiffness. You may also experience headaches, dizziness, blurred vision, fatigue, or difficulty concentrating. If you experience any of these symptoms after an accident, you must see our chiropractor as soon as possible.</p>\n<h2>How Is Whiplash Diagnosed?</h2>\n<p>Our chiropractor will take a complete medical history and perform a physical examination. They may also order X-rays, MRI, or CT scan, to rule out other causes of your symptoms. Yet, the symptoms of whiplash might not appear for days or even weeks after an accident. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s essential to see our chiropractor, even if you don&#8217;t have any symptoms yet.</p>\n<p>In addition, our chiropractor will determine if your symptoms are due to whiplash or another type of neck injury.</p>\n<h2>How Is Whiplash Treated?</h2>\n<p>The goal of treatment is to relieve pain and restore normal range of motion in the neck. Your treatment plan may include chiropractic adjustments, massage therapy, physical therapy, and exercises. In some cases, our chiropractor may also recommend taking time off work so you can focus on your recovery.</p>\n<p>When you&#8217;re well-rested, you can begin treatment and start on the road to recovery. Our chiropractor will also provide follow-up care and pain management to treat your whiplash effectively.</p>\n<h3>Don&#8217;t Suffer from Whiplash, Contact Tropea Chiropractic Inc.</h3>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve been in a car accident and are looking for a chiropractor near me, it&#8217;s essential to seek chiropractic care as soon as possible.

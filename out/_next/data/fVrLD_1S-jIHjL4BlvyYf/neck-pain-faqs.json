Neck pain is often caused by a narrowing of the spinal canal, a herniated disc, or a misalignment of the vertebrae. Muscle strain and whiplash are also common causes of neck pain. In addition, many patients who have neck pain experience discomfort due to an injury, poor posture, conducting strenuous activities, or sleeping in an improper position.</p>\n<h2>How Can Neck Pain Be Treated?</h2>\n<p>Treatment for neck pain depends on what is causing the pain and discomfort. Chiropractors can help diagnose the root cause of your neck pain and treat that source and not just the symptoms. Chiropractic care options include spinal manipulation, manual adjustments, soft tissue therapy, physical therapy, massage therapy, and acupuncture. Patients with herniated discs can also benefit from traction to help with neck pain.</p>\n<h2>When Should I See a Chiropractor for Neck Pain?</h2>\n<p>When your neck pain lasts more than a week, it is time to schedule an appointment with a chiropractor. Waiting any longer may worsen the condition and prolong your recovery. Additionally, the neck pain may be a sign of another condition, disease, or problem, which may need to be treated sooner rather than later.</p>\n<h2>How Can I Prevent Neck Pain?</h2>\n<p>It is possible to prevent neck pain. For example, when working on a computer or at a desk, take regular breaks to stand up, change your posture, and stretch your muscles. Avoid activities that put too much strain on your neck and back muscles. Instead, focus on exercises that improve your posture and utilize proper lifting techniques.</p>\n<h3>Contact Our Chiropractor in Sunnyvale, CA</h3>\n<p>Neck pain can significantly affect your daily routine and may not go away on its own.

Something as simple as sleeping the wrong way can also cause these injuries. This type of back pain can cause tightness and back spasms that are painful and can affect your daily life. A chiropractor can use musculoskeletal manipulation to restore your body’s natural alignment, reducing pain and promoting mobility.</p>\n<h2>Herniated or Ruptured Discs</h2>\n<p>The bony vertebrae of your spine are separated by cushions called discs. If the discs move out of place and bulge, it can cause significant pain, making it challenging to get around. Discs are more prone to herniating or rupturing as you get older. A chiropractor can use stretching or traction to decompress the vertebrae, which will help treat your pain. They may also teach you strengthening exercises to ensure your spine is in proper alignment.</p>\n<h2>Sciatica</h2>\n<p>Sciatica occurs when the sciatic nerve is compressed by a bone spur on the spine, a herniated disc, or narrowing of the spine, also known as spinal stenosis. This condition causes a sharp or shooting pain that starts in the back and travels through the buttock and down the back of your leg. Many people compare the pain to an electric shock, and the pain is often worsened after long periods of sitting. Sciatica often doesn&#8217;t cause discomfort when working out, but you will feel pain afterward. A chiropractor can use spinal manipulation and cold and hot therapy to ease the pain without medication.</p>\n<h2>Spinal Osteoarthritis</h2>\n<p>Spinal osteoarthritis occurs when the cartilage of the joints and discs in the neck and lower back begin to break down, and bone spurs can form. The risk factor for this condition include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Advanced age</li>\n<li>Family history of osteoarthritis</li>\n<li>Jobs that involve repetitive stress on the back</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A chiropractor can use a few different treatments to treat pain, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Stretching and massage</li>\n<li>Heat and cold therapy</li>\n<li>Ultrasound</li>\n<li>Low-level laser</li>\n<li>Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS)</li>\n<li>Joint manipulation</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These treatments can help ease your pain and improve your mobility.</p>\n<h3>Schedule an Appointment with Our Chiropractor in Sunnyvale, CA for Back Pain Treatment</h3>\n<p>If you suffer from back pain, call Tropea Chiropractic Inc in Sunnyvale, CA.

When back problems cause compression on the sciatic nerve, it can lead to the condition known as sciatica. Common symptoms include pain of varying intensity and frequency, numbness or tingling in the legs, and even a loss of function in the legs. It’s important to identify and treat the source of the pinched nerve, or sciatica can become chronic and worsen over time.</p>\n<h2>How Chiropractic Care Treats Sciatica</h2>\n<p>The root cause of the compression of the nerve can come from several sources. Some of the most common include herniated discs, piriformis syndrome, arthritis, and repetitive stress. In some cases, simply sitting on a wallet over a lifetime is enough to trigger the condition. That’s why the first step for your chiropractor will be to diagnose the source of your sciatica. Depending on the cause, treatments can vary by a wide range.</p>\n<p>With the underlying cause determined, your chiropractor will work with you to develop a treatment course. It may include ice therapy, ultrasound, TENS (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation), and spinal manipulation. Regardless of the treatment path, the care will focus on drug-free, non-invasive procedures. The primary focus of chiropractic is to remove the source of your pain and empower your body to heal itself. This develops a sustainable, holistic approach to health care.</p>\n<p>It is important to remember that some causes of sciatica cannot be treated with noninvasive options. Severe injuries and sources of inflammation may require surgery or similar invasive methods. If such a case is diagnosed, your chiropractor can work with you to find the right specialist to treat the issue.</p>\n<h3>Chiropractic Care for Sciatica in Sunnyvale, CA</h3>\n<p>Call Tropea Chiropractic Inc today at <a class=\"piwik_ignore\" href=\"tel:(408) 329-9604\">(408) 329-9604</a> for more information or to schedule an appointment with our chiropractor.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Sciatica Back pain can be completely debilitating.

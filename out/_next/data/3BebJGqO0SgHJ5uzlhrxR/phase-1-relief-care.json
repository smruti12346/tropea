In this first phase of care, the main goal is to reduce your symptoms. Sometimes this will require daily visits, or two to three visits per week for a time.</p>\n<p>Most people are under the assumption that if they don&#8217;t feel any pain that there is nothing wrong with them &#8211; that they are healthy. Unfortunately, pain is a very poor indicator of health. In fact, pain and other symptoms frequently only appear after a disease or other condition has become advanced.</p>\n<p>For example, consider a cavity in your tooth. Does it hurt when it first develops or only after it has become serious? How about heart disease? Regardless of whether you are talking about cancer, heart disease, diabetes, stress or problems with the spine, pain is usually the last thing to appear. When you begin chiropractic care, pain is also the first symptom to disappear, even though much of the underlying condition remains.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"col-sm-12 stacked alias-pcontent\">\n<div class=\"wrap__page-content\">\n<div class=\"wrap__page-content--inner\">\n<div class=\"editable__container editable__container \">\n<div class=\" editable__container--inner editable__container--inner\" data-component-name=\"editable\" data-component-alias=\"editable\">\n<picture><source srcset=\"https://cdcssl.ibsrv.net/ibimg/smb/767x1109_80/webmgr/1n/7/p/_SHARED/relief_care.png.webp\" media=\"(max-width: 767px)\" /><source srcset=\"https://cdcssl.ibsrv.net/ibimg/smb/1023x1479_80/webmgr/1n/7/p/_SHARED/relief_care.png.webp\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" /><source srcset=\"https://cdcssl.ibsrv.net/ibimg/smb/1400x2025_80/webmgr/1n/7/p/_SHARED/relief_care.png.webp\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1400px)\" /></picture>\n<h2>Thumbs Up to Relief</h2>\n<p>Many people go to a chiropractor because they are in pain.

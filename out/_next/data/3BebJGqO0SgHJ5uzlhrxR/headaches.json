Depending on the location of your headache pain — like your forehead or the base of your skull — Tropea Chiropractic Inc. can determine the likely cause of your</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Headaches.</li>\n<li>Common causes of headaches include:</li>\n<li>Muscle tension</li>\n<li>Dehydration</li>\n<li>Low blood sugar</li>\n<li>Caffeine sensitivity</li>\n<li>High blood pressure</li>\n<li>Poor posture</li>\n<li>Repetitive movements</li>\n<li>Physical exertion</li>\n</ul>\n<p>During a visit, your provider asks about your headache symptoms, when they occur, and anything you can do to relieve the pain. If you’ve been in a car accident or suffered an injury, they ask about the details of your accident to better understand your case.</p>\n<p>For more complex headaches and migraines, they may recommend that you keep a symptom log or food diary to look for triggers.</p>\n<h2>What&#8217;s the difference between a headache and a migraine?</h2>\n<p>Headaches and migraines have different presentations, especially with regard to the severity of your pain. You can feel headaches:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Wrapping around your head like a band</li>\n<li>At the base of your skull</li>\n<li>At your forehead or temples</li>\n<li>Behind your eyes</li>\n<li>At the top of your skull</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Headaches also have different pain qualities and may be achy, throbbing, or stabbing in nature.</p>\n<p>Migraines have more specific symptoms like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Severe, one-sided throbbing pain</li>\n<li>Sensitivity to light, sound, and smell</li>\n<li>Jaw or facial pain</li>\n<li>Nausea and vomiting</li>\n<li>Visual disturbances, like seeing flashes of light</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Migraines can be accompanied by an aura, or a sense that a migraine is about to occur. Migraines tend to last longer than headaches and can extend from 4-72 hours in length. Often laying down in a dark, quiet room is the best way to reduce migraine symptoms.</p>\n<h2>How are headaches treated?</h2>\n<p>Treatment for your headaches depends on the cause. In addition to drinking plenty of water and eating at regular intervals to stabilize your blood sugar, you can visit Tropea Chiropractic Inc. to relieve headache symptoms using:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Chiropractic adjustments</li>\n<li>Physical therapy</li>\n<li>Postural training</li>\n<li>Electrical muscle stimulation</li>\n<li>Soft tissue therapy, like massage and trigger point work</li>\n<li>Traction</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These therapies can relieve both headache and migraine symptoms. Chiropractic care can be used alongside other headache and migraine treatments safely since it doesn&#8217;t involve medications that could cause side effects.</p>\n<p>To find out how care at Tropea Chiropractic Inc. can relieve your headaches, call or schedule an appointment online now and get started.</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Headaches Treatment in Sunnyvale, CA Tropea Chiropractic Inc.

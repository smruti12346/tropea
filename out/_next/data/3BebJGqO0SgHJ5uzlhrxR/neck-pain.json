Begin treatment today by scheduling your consultation and exam online or by phone and get the pain relief you need.</p>\n<h2><strong>Neck Pain Q &amp; A</strong></h2>\n<h2>Why does my neck hurt?</h2>\n<p>Neck pain is the result of injuries or irritation to the joints, muscles, or ligaments of your cervical spine â€” the first seven vertebrae of your spine located between your skull and shoulders. The vertebrae of your cervical spine function to allow full range of motion of your neck while supporting the weight of your head.</p>\n<p>If the joints, muscles, or ligaments in your neck are injured or irritated or compress the nerves that extend from your neck into your arms, you can experience pain, decreased range of motion, muscle spasms, and numbness or tingling in your arms and hands.</p>\n<p>In addition to trauma from auto accidents and personal injuries, neck pain can stem from poor posture, poor sleeping position, improper ergonomics when working, or repetitive injuries.</p>\n<h2>What conditions cause neck pain?</h2>\n<p>A variety of conditions can cause neck pain, like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Intersegmental joint dysfunction</li>\n<li>Facet syndrome</li>\n<li>Spinal stenosis</li>\n<li>Arthritis</li>\n<li>Whiplash</li>\n<li>Degenerative disc disease</li>\n<li>Tension headaches</li>\n<li>Cervical disc bulges or herniations</li>\n<li>Cervical radiculopathy</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Depending on the location of your pain and the severity of your symptoms, your provider can determine which orthopedic tests you need to determine your diagnosis.</p>\n<h2>How is neck pain diagnosed?</h2>\n<p>Tropea Chiropractic Inc. begins your first visit with a consultation and physical exam. Your provider starts by asking about your symptoms, when they are at their worst, and any steps you&#8217;ve taken to relieve the pain, like stretching or applying ice.</p>\n<p>Your provider then performs a physical exam and orthopedic assessment to measure your range of motion, assess the strength of the muscles in your neck, and check for signs of nerve or disc injuries. These tests may aggravate your pain, so let your provider know if you&#8217;re uncomfortable. In some cases, you need X-rays or an MRI to determine your diagnosis.</p>\n<p>For imaging and additional testing, Tropea Chiropractic Inc. provides referrals as needed.</p>\n<h2>What neck pain treatments are available?</h2>\n<p>The Tropea Chiropractic Inc. office has extensive rehab and therapy facilities to care for all types of neck pain. Your provider may recommend one or more of the following treatments to address your neck pain.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Chiropractic adjustments</li>\n<li>Physical therapy</li>\n<li>Massage therapy</li>\n<li>Postural correction</li>\n<li>Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation (PNF) for muscle spasms and trigger points</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can have these therapies individually or together to relieve your pain, improve your range of motion, and strengthen your neck.</p>\n<p>To schedule a consultation for neck pain, call Tropea Chiropractic Inc. or book online now.</p>\n</p>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Neck Pain Treatment in Sunnyvale, CA Tropea Chiropractic Inc.

Before beginning treatment, the chiropractor must learn more about what is causing your pain. Once the root cause of the pain is determined, the chiropractor will start a series of treatments designed to treat the cause of your pain and not the symptoms.</p>\n<h2>Chiropractic Care for Shoulder Pain</h2>\n<p>Shoulder pain occurs when the shoulder joints are misaligned or from improper spinal column alignment. When the musculoskeletal system moves out of alignment, it can cause pain, inflammation, and muscle spasms, which can cause shoulder pain. Chiropractic care helps realign the body, relieving pressure on the body’s joints. Chiropractic care for shoulder pain may include manual manipulation, chiropractic adjustment, massage therapy, acupuncture, laser therapy, stretching exercises, and physical therapy. When the neck and back are correctly adjusted, it can help minimize shoulder pain.</p>\n<h2><strong>Health Benefits of Chiropractic Care for Shoulder Pain</strong></h2>\n<p>Chiropractic care can provide many health and wellness benefits for the body. For example, the typical benefits of using chiropractic care to treat shoulder pain include reducing inflammation and pain. Chiropractic care helps improve range of motion, flexibility, muscle strength, and tone.</p>\n<h2>Chiropractic Care for Posture Issues</h2>\n<p>Many people suffer from shoulder pain caused by posture issues. For example, having poor posture while sitting or standing for prolonged periods can cause a condition known as a postural syndrome. This syndrome occurs when the shoulders roll toward the cheek, causing the shoulders to slump and the head to lean forward. Chiropractic care can help treat posture issues, which can help alleviate shoulder pain.</p>\n<h2>Schedule a Chiropractic Care Appointment Today in Sunnyvale, CA</h2>\n<p>If you suffer from shoulder pain interfering with your ability to work or live life normally, it might be time to schedule a chiropractic care appointment.

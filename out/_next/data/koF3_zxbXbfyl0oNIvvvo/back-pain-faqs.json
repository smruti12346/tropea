For one thing, scientific research describes several risk factors for low back pain which tend to affect a significant portion of the general population. These risk factors include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Advancing age</li>\n<li>Family history or personal history of back pain</li>\n<li>Frequent sitting, heavy lifting, bending and twisting</li>\n<li>Physically demanding occupations and hobbies</li>\n<li>Stress</li>\n<li>Smoking</li>\n<li>Other underlying health conditions, like obesity, depression, and fibromyalgia</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Back pain is also common because the spine contains hundreds of bones, muscles, nerves, ligaments, tendons, joints, and other connective tissues that are susceptible to injury and the effects of cumulative, age-related changes in tissue health and function.</p>\n<p>Your spine must protect your nervous system, absorb forces, and support your entire body.</p>\n<h2>What Causes Back Pain?</h2>\n<p>Common causes of back pain include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Spinal stenosis</b>, or the gradual narrowing of bony spaces in the spine, can cause stiffness, pain, and spinal nerve root compression</li>\n<li><b>Sciatica</b>, a condition that occurs when one or both of the sciatic nerves in the lower back become pinched and irritated</li>\n<li><b>Spondylosis</b> (a type of arthritis affecting the spine)</li>\n<li><b>Spinal muscle spasms </b></li>\n<li><b>Ligament sprains</b></li>\n<li><b>Acute trauma</b> like falls, car crashes, or lifting injuries</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chronic back pain can also develop without a clear cause or diagnosis.</p>\n<h2>What Are the Benefits of Chiropractic Care for Back Pain?</h2>\n<p>Chiropractic care is beneficial for back pain because:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It includes non-invasive and drug-free techniques that are safe for people of all ages and health backgrounds</li>\n<li>It features services like chiropractic adjustments that help the nervous system switch into a restorative, healing mode instead of a chronically stressed, &#8220;fight or flight&#8221; mode associated with pain, illness, and injury</li>\n<li>It can be personalized to fit the specific needs of each patient</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By implementing lifestyle modifications, body mechanics training, and corrective exercises, our  chiropractor can help people avoid future or recurring back pain</p>\n<h3>Schedule an Appointment with Our Chiropractor in Sunnyvale, CA</h3>\n<p>Call Tropea Chiropractic, Inc. today at <a class=\"piwik_ignore\" href=\"tel:(408) 329-9604\">(408) 329-9604</a> for more information or to schedule an appointment with our chiropractor.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Back Pain FAQs If you live near Sunnyvale, CA, and have been looking for a chiropractor who can help you get lasting low back pain relief, we encourage you to connect with our team at Tropea Chiropractic, Inc.

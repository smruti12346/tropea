When building a house, if you tried to put up your walls before you had a solid foundation, your walls would be weak and eventually collapse. If you tried to put on your roof before the walls were ready, you would run into the same problem. The same is true for your body. Your body has to go through a particular plan of care in order to repair itself correctly and fully. There are three general phases of chiropractic care:</p>\n<picture><source srcset=\"https://cdcssl.ibsrv.net/ibimg/smb/767x1088_80/webmgr/1n/7/p/_SHARED/patient_expect.png.webp\" media=\"(max-width: 767px)\" /></picture>\n<picture><source srcset=\"https://cdcssl.ibsrv.net/ibimg/smb/1023x1452_80/webmgr/1n/7/p/_SHARED/patient_expect.png.webp\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" /></picture>\n<picture><source srcset=\"https://cdcssl.ibsrv.net/ibimg/smb/1400x1987_80/webmgr/1n/7/p/_SHARED/patient_expect.png.webp\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1400px)\" /></picture>\n<picture><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"align-none\" style=\"aspect-ratio: 0.7047; float: right;\" src=\"https://api.tonytropeadc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/patient_expect.png.webp\" alt=\"Image of an architect. \" /></picture>\n<h2>Phase 1: Relief Care</h2>\n<p>If you are in pain when you come into our office, the first objective is to help you feel better. Depending on the severity of your problem, it is typical to need care two to three times per week for four to 12 weeks.</p>\n<h2>Phase 2: Corrective/Restorative Care</h2>\n<p>During the corrective care phase, muscles and other tissues are allowed to heal more completely, thereby helping prevent injury. It is typical to need care four to eight times per month for six to 24 months, depending on your overall health and the severity of your problem.</p>\n<h2>Phase 3: Wellness Care</h2>\n<p>Once your body has fully healed, it is important to come in for periodic adjustments to avoid problems in the future. Usually, this only requires a quick visit to the chiropractor one to four times per month, based on your lifestyle and goals.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What to Expect Laying the Foundation for Total Health Chiropractic care is like building a house &#8211; certain things have to happen in a particular order in order for everything to stand strong and work correctly.

Our chiropractor can reduce shoulder pain by realigning your spine and correcting misalignments that might cause tension in your shoulder muscles. Today, we&#8217;ll highlight how chiropractic care can help ease shoulder pain.</p>\n<h2>How Can Shoulder Alignments Help?</h2>\n<p>One of the most common causes of shoulder pain is a misalignment in the spine or shoulder. When your spine is out of alignment, it puts pressure on your shoulder muscles and nerves, leading to pain.</p>\n<p>Our chiropractor can help by realigning your spine and correcting any misalignments in your shoulder. This alignment will take the pressure off your shoulder muscles and nerves and helps reduce pain.</p>\n<h2>What Is a Muscle Tension Release?</h2>\n<p>Another common cause of shoulder pain is muscle tension. When your shoulder muscles are tight, they can pull on your spine and neck, leading to pain.</p>\n<p>Our chiropractor can help by releasing the tension in your shoulder muscles. This release will help reduce pain and improve the range of motion. This tactic also accelerates recovery from shoulder injuries, especially in athletes.</p>\n<h2>Where Is Electrical Stimulation Used?</h2>\n<p>Electrical stimulation is a popular treatment for shoulder pain. This therapy uses electrical impulses to stimulate the nerves in your shoulder, which can help reduce pain. Our chiropractor can help by applying electrical stimulation to your shoulder muscles.</p>\n<p>The electrical currents will stimulate specific nerve cells. These nerve cells will block the transmission of pain signals to the brain, eliminating shoulder pain.</p>\n<h2>Why Does the Graston Technique Help?</h2>\n<p>The Graston Technique is a therapy that uses special instruments to massage the muscles and break up scar tissue. This therapy can treat shoulder pain caused by muscle tension or injuries.</p>\n<p>Our chiropractor can help by using the Graston Technique to massage your shoulder muscles and break up scar tissue. This massage will help reduce pain and improve how the shoulder moves. The procedure is painless, and, most importantly, it works.</p>\n<h3>Let Tropea Chiropractic Inc.

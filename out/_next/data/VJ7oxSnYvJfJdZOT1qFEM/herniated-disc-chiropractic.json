This damage can occur from injury, aging, or simply normal wear and tear on the spine. When a disc splits open or bulges out of place, it can press on surrounding nerves, leading to symptoms such as pain, numbness, and tingling.</p>\n<p>It is not the same as a bulging disc. A bulging disc is where the disc stays within its common space, but it causes a bulge in the wrong direction that can compress nerves.</p>\n<h2>What Are the Symptoms of a Herniated Disc?</h2>\n<p>Common symptoms of a herniated disc include pain, numbness, and tingling in the area around the spine. You may also experience weakness in the limbs or difficulty moving your body. Depending on the location of the herniated disc, you may also experience headaches or pressure near the spine.</p>\n<h2>How Can Tropea Chiropractic Inc. Help?</h2>\n<p>At Tropea Chiropractic Inc, we specialize in providing non-invasive treatments for herniated discs. Our treatments involve gentle manipulations of the spine that help realign it into its proper position and reduce pressure on the surrounding nerves.</p>\n<p>Some of the best chiropractic care techniques we can provide for herniated discs are spinal decompression, which involves stretching the spine to reduce pressure, and cold laser therapy, which can help reduce inflammation and improve blood flow. We also provide massage therapy and physiotherapy exercises that can further reduce symptoms.</p>\n<p>No matter what your treatment plan looks like, you can be sure that we will always address your individual needs with personalized care. Our goal is to provide a safe and effective solution while helping our patients recover from herniated disc pain and return to an active life.</p>\n<h3>Find Relief from Herniated Disc Today</h3>\n<p>If you’re looking for a chiropractor near me in Sunnyvale, CA, who specializes in herniated disc treatments, contact Tropea Chiropractic Inc.</p>\n<p>Our experienced team of chiropractors will work with you to develop a personalized treatment plan that will help you find relief from your back pain.

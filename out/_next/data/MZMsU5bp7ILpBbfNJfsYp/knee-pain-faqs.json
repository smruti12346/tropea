Visit us today in Sunnyvale, CA, for quality chiropractic care.\n  </p>\n<h2>What is causing my knee pain?</h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s only natural that you&#8217;d want to know what&#8217;s causing your knee pain. There are many potential causes, and one of the most common is osteoarthritis. This condition occurs when the cartilage that cushions your joints wears away, causing pain and inflammation. Other possible causes of knee pain include injury, bursitis, gout, and tendinitis. Visit a chiropractor for an accurate diagnosis.\n  </p>\n<h2>When should I seek treatment for knee pain?</h2>\n<p>Sometimes knee pain will go away on its own with at-home treatments such as ice and rest. However, if your pain is severe or doesn&#8217;t go away after a few days, it&#8217;s time to seek professional treatment. Let our chiropractor at Tropea Chiropractic Inc take a look at your knee to determine the pain source and recommend appropriate treatment.\n  </p>\n<h2>Am I at risk of knee pain?</h2>\n<p>Anyone can develop knee pain, but there are certain factors that increase your risk. These include age, obesity, joint deformities, and overuse. As you age, the knee joint becomes less stable and more vulnerable to injury. If you are obese, excess weight puts added pressure on your knees, which can lead to pain. Overusing your knees can also lead to pain, so be sure to take breaks if you engage in activities that put strain on your knees.\n  </p>\n<h2>How does chiropractic care help with knee pain?</h2>\n<p>Chiropractic care is a great way to address knee pain because it is noninvasive and drug-free. Our chiropractor will use gentle adjustments to reduce inflammation and improve joint function. We may also recommend exercises and other lifestyle changes to help you find relief from your knee pain. With regular chiropractic care, you can enjoy greater mobility and a better quality of life.\n  </p>\n<h3>Visit Tropea Chiropractic Inc for Knee Pain Treatment in Sunnyvale, CA</h3>\n<p>We use our knees every day.
